# Numbers game on Coxeter graphs

Code for my advancement.
I originally wrote this code in 2022-2023, but at the time, I didn't know
anything about writing code, documentation, version control, etc.
I wanted to fix things up a bit.

## Warning
The code in this repository is currently in an incomplete state because at the
time I wrote my original code for my advancement exam, everything was in a
messy Sage workbook on CoCalc. Dealing with that workbook was and is painful,
so it may take some time to move everything over to this repo: I want to make
sure that what I have here is readable and follows better practices than my old
code in the CoCalc workbook.
